violence its is hardcore in the classic use of the word it is called oz as that is the nickname given to the oswald maximum security state penitentary it focuses mainly on emerald city an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards so privacy is not high on the agenda them city is home to many aryans muslims gangstas latinos christians italians irish and more so scuffles death stares dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away i would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows would not dare forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences forget charm forget romance oz does not mess around the first episode i ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal i could not say i was ready for it but as i watched more i developed a taste for oz and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence not just violence but injustice crooked guards who will be sold out for a nickel inmates who will kill on order and get away with it well mannered middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience watching oz you may become
